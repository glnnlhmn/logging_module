## Notes

I found this tutorial to great introduction to logging in python.  My biggest takeaway
from this course was learning a logger can only be initialized once.

_I reviewed another logging tutorial and found it useful._

## Presentation

I used the material I have researched and created a presentation on logging in python. The presentation is scheduled to be presented as part of the Boston Python study group on 9 Feb 2023

The presentation includes some simple workshops exercises to help the audience understand the concepts.

See [Instructions.md](Instructions.md) for more information.
